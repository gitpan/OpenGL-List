NAME
    OpenGL::List - Massively optimise your Perl OpenGL program with display
    lists

DESCRIPTION
  glpList
      my $list_name = glpList {
          glBegin( GL_LINES );
          glVertex3f( 0, 0, 0 );
          glVertex3f( 1, 0, 0 );
          glVertex3f( 0, 0, 0 );
          glVertex3f( 0, 1, 0 );
          glVertex3f( 0, 0, 0 );
          glVertex3f( 0, 0, 1 );
          glEnd();
      };

    The glpLine function is used to define a block of Perl OpenGL
    instructions that should be immediately compiled into a display list.

    Returns a new display list name that can be passed to glCallList()
    later.
